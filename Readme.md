#Introduction<br/> 
#==========
This library of functions was developed to meet the needs of the RMG Data Team working primarily with Quality and Absence data generated by the RMG projects in Bangladesh.

The module provides tools for creating a single DataFrame from a multi-wroksheet ExcelFile. The tools require that a descriptive "workbook structure" object such as that created when using WorkbookFunctions be  passed to the functions in order to extract data from the ExcelFile. 

This readme will be updated shortly after testing...
